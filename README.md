# econometrics-in-r
This is a repository for my work learning the techniques, tests, and models of introductory econometrics in R.

`metrics.Rmd` is not fully knittable from this repository because it requires some LaTeX settings in a `preamble.tex` file reference in the YAML header. Otherwise, the PDF is entirely reproducible.
